# AI ThreeJS Product Web Application

Hi Future Developer!

Welcome to my project! This time, I'm crafting a cutting-edge web application that's not only powerful but also seamlessly integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI). This innovative application is all about designing products, particularly T-Shirts, displayed in a remarkably stylish and elegant 3D model that's fully customizable to suit your preferences.

Within this app, you'll find an array of user-friendly functions, including:

- [x] Crafting T-Shirt designs using a sophisticated 3D model
- [x] Effortlessly changing T-Shirt colors with a handy color picker
- [x] Swapping out logos or textures on the T-Shirt by uploading your own images
- [x] Harnessing AI to generate unique logos or textures for your T-Shirt

While the application is still in its developmental stage and may have some limitations, I'm eager to provide users with a valuable experience that can evolve and improve over time. Your input and experience will help shape the future of this exciting project.

Thank you for your interest. Happy coding!
